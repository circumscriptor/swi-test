Most people think of grass as something to be mowed, not something to be touched. However, there
are many benefits to touching grass. For one, it can help to relieve stress. The act of running
your hands through grass can help to stimulate the release of serotonin, which is a
neurotransmitter that helps to promote feelings of happiness and well-being. Additionally,
touching grass can help to ground you. This is because the Earth's natural electrical field can
help to encourage a sense of calm and relaxation. If you're feeling overwhelmed or anxious, take
a moment to touch some grass. You may just find it helps to center and calm you.
